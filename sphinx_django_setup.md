# Installation

In the projects Python virtual enviroment install sphinx will the following command.

```shell
	pip install Sphinx
```

# Setup
Sphinx needs to be setup onces to auto read comments and generate docs. Follow the steps below for any django/python project.

### Run the command
Switch to the root directory of the project. And run the following command.
```
	sphinx-quickstart
```
### Select options for the projects
**sphinx-quickstart** command will ask u multiple questions, I will show you most of the default answers for the question. But you are free to answer differently depending upon your need


```
> Root path for the documentation [.]: ./docs

Enter the root path for documentation.
```

```
> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: n

You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output. Either, you use a directory “_build” within the root path, or you separate “source” and “build” directories within the root path.
```
```
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: _

Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; “_templates” for custom HTML templates and “_static” for custom stylesheets and other static files. You can enter another prefix (such as “.”) to replace the underscore.
```

```
> Project name: classcloud
> Author name(s): Zaya Developers

The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
```

```
> Project version: 1.0
> Project release [1.0]: 1.0

Sphinx has the notion of a “version” and a “release” for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don’t need this dual structure, just set both to the same value.
```

```
> Project language [en]: en

Default language for documentation.

```

```
> Source file suffix [.rst]: .rst

The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either “.txt” or “.rst”.  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
```

```
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: index

One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
“contents tree”, that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure of the documents. Normally, this is “index”, but if your “index” document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
```

```
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/n) [n]: n

Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output
```

```
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/n) [n]: y
> doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/n) [n]: n
> intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/n) [n]: y
> todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/n) [n]: y
> coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/n) [n]: y
> imgmath: include math, rendered as PNG or SVG images (y/n) [n]: n
> mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/n) [n]: n
> ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/n) [n]: n
> viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/n) [n]: n
> githubpages: create .nojekyll file to publish the document on GitHub pages (y/n) [n]: n



Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions 
```
```
> Create Makefile? (y/n) [y]: y
> Create Windows command file? (y/n) [y]: n

A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you only have to run e.g. ‘make html’ instead of invoking sphinx-build directly.
```

This will create a docs folder inside your project folder, containing the files conf.py, index.rst and Makefile, and the folders _build, _static and _templates (which will be empty).


**Note**
>The autodoc extension is needed to import the docstrings of your project files into the documentation.

>autodoc, todo, coverage must be enabled for better documentation process.

>Its always a better option to create a seperate **docs** directory for storing file generated by sphinx. 


### Setting up sphinx for django

Open the following file **docs/conf.py** and insert the following code at the end to allow sphinx to find django apps for your projects.

```python

import sys
import os

# Absolute path for the project root directory
PROJECT_ROOT_DIR = os.path.abspath('./project_name')

# Add project to python path
sys.path.insert(0, PROJECT_ROOT_DIR)

# Configure django settings
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'project_name.settings')
import django
django.setup()

```

### Make sphinx discover docs

* In the **docs** folder create a seprate folder for each app. In the new folder create a **index.rst** Here we will assume he have a app named content.

```
	mkdir docs/content
	touch docs/content/index.rst
```

* Now edit the **docs/content/index.rst** to include all **".py"** u want to be included in doc generation

example
```
Content
************************
Basic intro to the app


Models
======
.. automodule:: content.models
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :inherited-members:
    :show-inheritance:

View
======
.. automodule:: content.views
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :inherited-members:
    :show-inheritance:

Utils
=========
.. automodule:: content.utils
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :inherited-members:
    :show-inheritance:
```
Here each **".py"** is maintained in the statment **.. automodule:: content.utils**. 
[More information on formating](https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html)

* Edit **docs/index.rst** to include the newly created file.

example
```

Welcome to sphinxtest's documentation! (Change this to project title)
==========================================================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

   content/index
```

Thats done

# Building
For bulding html docs for the project run the following commands
```
	cd docs/
	make html
```
The above command will build the html in the folder **docs/_build/html** with **"index.html"** file.
